**Indie iOS maker.** I build small, sharp apps with a simple rule: **1 core hook, 1 supportive feature, 1 delight touch.** Lean, bold, and a little cosmic.

---

## What I’m exploring right now

- **Chat‑first productivity** and playful streak mechanics.
- **Micro‑breathwork tools** (30–60s resets, haptics + visuals).
- **Adaptive journaling** powered by AI (mood/themes → evolving prompts).
- **Idea card decks** for founders/creatives (pitch • plan • hook).
- **Stoic micro‑coaching**: daily discipline, minimal friction.

> I ship in small loops: scope → build → test → cut or double‑down.

---

## How I work

- **Agentic prompts**: a set of AI "teammates" for ops, CFO, design, market.
- **Windows + PowerShell**: local builds tuned via Cursor **user/project rules**.
- **1+1+1 discipline**: guardrails against feature bloat.
- **Fast validation**: if it’s not shareable in 5 seconds, it needs rethinking.

---

## Tech I use

- **React Native + Expo** — cross‑platform core for iOS builds.
- **TypeScript** — strict, readable app code.
- **TailwindCSS/NativeWind** — utility‑first UI speed.
- **AI** — Gemini 2.5 (Pro/Flash), Claude Sonnet, GPT‑5 Thinking (for ideation + coaching).
- **Editor** — Cursor (auto mode, PowerShell‑friendly rules).
- **Versioning** — GitHub.

---

## What to expect here

- Public experiments, WIP prototypes, and sharable utilities.
- Clean READMEs, minimal setup steps, and tight scopes.
- Occasional write‑ups on lessons learned from rapid app cycles.

*If you want to follow along, star the repos that resonate. I keep things lean and ship often.*
