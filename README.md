**Systems you can trust.  
Intelligence that stays local.  
A platform built to outlive the cloud.**

## What I Build

I design sovereign AI systems that run local, stay private, and don’t disappear when you need them.  
My work centers on cognitive runtimes, safety architecture, and infrastructure you can trust under pressure.

Thynaptic is the platform.  
Mavaia is the runtime.  
Control is the outcome.

## Mavaia

A cognitive-local intelligence runtime built for reliability, continuity, and full user ownership.

Core direction:

- Deterministic cognitive architecture  
- Local-first execution  
- Memory systems with real continuity  
- Safety layers that actually intervene  
- OpenAI-compatible API with a hardened security posture  

This is the backbone of the Thynaptic ecosystem.

## Security Posture

<div>

![Zero Trust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zero--Trust-Architecture-444?style=for-the-badge)
![Air-Gap Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Air--Gap-Ready-0A3?style=for-the-badge)

</div>

Sovereign systems demand sovereign security.  
Everything is built under offensive assumptions.

- Deterministic API behavior and stable error envelopes  
- Complete OWASP hardening across API, UI, provider, and network layers  
- Enforced offline egress isolation with allowlist-only outbound rules  
- Hashed API keys with per-key scopes, quotas, rotation, and audit trails  
- SIEM-friendly audit streams with request-level decision logs  
- Air-gap compliance checks and zero-trust defaults  
- Provider readiness probes, graceful drains, and deterministic failure semantics  

The posture is simple: assume pressure, and remain unbroken.
