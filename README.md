## What I Build

I design sovereign AI systems that run local, stay private, and don’t disappear when you need them.  
My work focuses on cognitive runtimes, safety architecture, and infrastructure you can trust under pressure.

**Thynaptic is the platform.  
Mavaia is the engine.  
The goal is control.**

## Mavaia

A cognitive-local intelligence runtime built for reliability, continuity, and full user ownership.

Core direction:
- Deterministic cognitive architecture  
- Local-first execution  
- Memory systems with real continuity  
- Safety layers that actually intervene  
- OpenAI-compatible API with a hardened security posture  

This is the backbone of the Thynaptic ecosystem.

## Thynaptic Research

Technical papers outlining the architecture, safety model, cognitive design, and long-term direction of the ecosystem.
