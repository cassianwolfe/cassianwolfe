**Indie AI builder.** I design and ship tools built around one idea: **assistive intelligence that stays local, fast, and personal.**
Simple systems. Sharp boundaries. Zero fluff.

---

## What I'm focused on right now

* **C-LLM architecture** and the Aurora Runtime pipeline.
* **Local-first personal AI** with persistent cognitive state.
* **FocusOS** — my calm, on-device OS layer for productivity.
* **Hybrid inference research** (routing, model selection, cognitive depth).
* **Ultra-tight app design**: fast, clean, and frictionless.

> My whole workflow is: think in systems, ship in loops, cut aggressively.

## How I build

* **Cognitive pipelines** instead of monolithic prompts.
* **A full bench of AI “agents”** for research, analysis, design, ops.
* **Cursor as my engineering cockpit** with planning mode for architecture and agent mode for execution.
* **Local-first mentality** — privacy, speed, autonomy.
* **Structure over hype** — everything serves the product.

---

## Tech & tools

* **Swift + SwiftUI** — native iOS/macOS builds.
* **Aurora Runtime** — my C-LLM engine for on-device cognition.
* **Python Brain Modules** — external reasoning blocks when depth matters.
* **Ollama** — local model stack for hybrid inference.
* **AI** — Claude, GPT-5, Gemini for research iterations.
* **Cursor** — rulesets, planning flows, auto-refactor.
* **GitHub** — versioning + public drops.

---

## What you'll find here

* Thynaptic research drops.
* C-LLM experiments, prototypes, and runtime components.
* FocusOS utilities and personal tools.
* Clean READMEs and well-scoped repos.
* Real things I use — nothing ornamental.

*If any of this hits, star what resonates. I ship often and I don’t waste motion.*
